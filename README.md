## Post-hoc explainability methods
<a name="section-id2"></a>
> Post-hoc XIFD methods aim to explain how a trained model produce predictions for any decision-making process with a given input by developing additional explainers or techniques, which can be further categorized into local explainability and global explainability depending on the object and destination of the explanation..

## Ante-hoc explainability methods
<a name="section-id5"></a>
### Attention Mechanism Assisted Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Methods 
<a name="section-id6"></a>
Attention mechanisms provide a way to help understand what to focus on during model learning, and it allows the model to automatically and selectively focus on important information and ignore unimportant information when dealing with large amounts of input data in order to achieve transparency and visualization of the decision-making process, which in turn enhances the model explainability.

### Physics-informed intelligent fault diagnosis methods
<a name="section-id7"></a>
Currently, there are two ways to implement PIFD, where the first way is to establish a physical simulation model (PSM) and generate corresponding data to assist in model training, thereby guiding the model to effectively extract fault features. While the second way embeds physics equations as the loss function of the model to guide model training, such as the recently emerging physics-informed neural networks (PINN).
